      Configure this computer's backend once, then start it:
        commandeer-setup --central https://<central>/ --supabase-url https://<project>.supabase.co --supabase-key <publishable key>
        brew services start commandeer
      commandeer-setup prints the same enrollment line with this computer's paths.
      State and sign-in live outside this package, so brew upgrade keeps them.
      Enroll this computer once, after commandeer-setup wrote host.json:
        #{opt_bin}/conversation-host login "#{broker}/host.json" "#{broker}/device.json"
        Add --github before the two files only when the central server has GitHub sign-in configured.
